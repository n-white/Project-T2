Trump was on the record as supportive of the Iraq War as early as a month before Congress voted to authorize military force in Iraq and even soon after the invasion. He didn't express his outright opposition to the war until more than a year later, in an August 2004 interview. http://cnn.it/2dv9Nuv #CNNRealityCheck",Reality Check: Trump and Iraq War,video,https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/10155366590031509/,2016-09-26 21:48:24,24412,4212,6559,19571,576,253,3702,32,278
